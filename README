# HOWTO
 0. Requirements (AFAIK)
  * MacOS or CentOS
  * ADK
  * NDK-r7c
  * upgrade config.sub of automake (for Linux if necessary)
  * git 1.7.9.4 (or above)
  * cmake 2.8.7 (not tested with lower version)
  * automake 1.11.3 (do not use 1.12 or above)

 1. Install necessary tools.
    Read this article http://www.doitscared.com/?p=649

 2. Fetch build scripts for mac
    git clone git@github.com:bbcallen/vlc-android-macbuild.git vlc-android-macbuild

 3. Start build
    cd vlc-android-macbuild
    sh _pull-full-armv7a-neon.sh
    cd vlc-fule-armv7a-neon
    sh _reset_vlc.sh

# NOTICE
 0. This build is only for cross-compiling on MacOS, as I don't have setup any other *nix OS for now. You should follow the offical build if you need build on other *nix OS.

 1. Patches under /patches/vlc is OK for other build OS. They are licensed under LGPLv2.1, hmmm, supposed.

 2. This build is used in my own app. Some jni interfaces have been modified. You should modify or ignore patches under /patches/ports-android and /patches/vlc. Mail me if you have any problem about these patches.

#TROUBLESHOOT
 * Invalid configuration `arm-linux-androideabi'
   upgrade config.sub of automake, see _install_libs_on_centos.sh for more information
